<h1>Hypertexxt Webring</h1>
I am apart of the Hypertexxt Webring, the second 'x' denoting a sort of "x-factor" that has become unnoticed on the WWW where hypertext documents reside. 
The internet will never be boring, but there's too much lost when our attention is siphoned into the same 5 or so social media giants that
keep us kenned inside walled gardens.
I became so tired of being forcefed pay-per-click/view content and having my attention hijacked by avaricious algorithms that I set to making the finnter.net:
 my very own face of the internet where I am in control.
 I've had many conversations about the state of cyber society with my friend who runs her own website, so we decided to start a webring together!

 <br>
Some things I'm interested in discussing in our nascent network, some of which may turn into articles in the future:
<ul>
    <li>synesthetics of web experience (audio-visual, but also haptics, I'm addicted and a large part of it is the typing and clicking!)</li>
    <li>weaving and webmistressing</li>
    <li>cybermedievalism... so much to say about this one, but I'll start with the fact that the pre-modern world was much more interconnected than we tend to give it credit for.</li>
    <li>Xanadu or Xanadon't: Ted Nelson and the History of Hypertext</li>
    <li>The loss of (digital) autonomy and coinciding trends of personal fashion and micro-identities (specialization)</li>
    <li>Curation versus Automation: From the Joy of Linking versus nascent search engines to AI enshittification of spell and grammar checks</li>
    <li>The materiality of cyberspace, mapping cyberspace. (We sometimes act like this is all out in the ether, but servers are real! data is real! the electrical grid is real!)</li>
  <li>Reflexivity and self-consciousness of digital media: "the internet we were promised" and the trappings of nostalgia </li>
  <li>Modern memetics: internet aesthetics, accessibility, and rates of consumption</li>
  <li>Modern memetics 2: academia and digitization</li>
  <li>Simulacralty: Skeuomorphism vs Abstraction in tech</li>
  <li>Copper Kings from mines to power lines: a history of corporate control, land stewardship, and socialism in Montana</li>
  </ul>
